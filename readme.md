Login portals for Contractors and Drivers.
Contractors can access and manage all the details of Clients,Drivers and Trashcans.
Contractor will provide the Username and passwords to drivers.
Drivers will get the real-time reading from the trash cans within their login-portal.

Working:
First ultasonic sensor is used to measure the filled Trashcan and send the data to the ubidots server.From their we fetch out the data in our web application (driversâ€™ portal) for a particular trashcan associated with that driver.
Second ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the  person standing near it and the flap of trashcan will open automatically using the servo motor.
